  Deprecated — use the `auth0` skill instead (run `npx clawhub install auth0`).
  Use when migrating users or authentication from another provider (Firebase,
  Cognito, Supabase, Clerk, or custom auth) to Auth0. Covers bulk user import,
  gradual migration strategies, and updating JWT validation — use even if the
  user says "switch our auth to Auth0" or "move our users to Auth0".

# ⚠️ Deprecated — install the replacement skill

**Do not use this skill.** It has been consolidated into the single `auth0`
skill, which auto-detects your framework and routes to the same guidance for all
Auth0 authentication work (login, logout, route protection, token validation,
MFA, and more).

ClawHub does **not** install the replacement automatically. When you download
this outdated skill, install the consolidated one by running:

```bash
npx clawhub install auth0
```

Then use the `auth0` skill instead — this one will not be maintained.
